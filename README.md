# GrainWeb

This is meant to be a web framework for the grain programming language, using the component model. This is currently just a proof of concept but can be used as a good starting point for a web project from grain, future work will hopefully be to generate native bindings using work being done [here webidl2wit](https://github.com/spotandjake/webidl2wit/tree/spotandjake-gen), this is also currently blocked by [this issue](https://github.com/grain-lang/wit-bindgen/issues/1), so some work is going to need to be done there.

# Other demos

If you are interested in less complete but more expansive bindings take a look at the `./domTest` and `./consoleTest` they each have their own `build.sh` which can be run with `bash ./build.sh` and then they will autohost a server their entrance points are their corresponding `main.gr` files. These bindings are a little different and are just an experiment they are generated using the test fixtures found [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/blob/main/test/fixtures/idl/dom.wit) and correspond directly to the [webidl dom api](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-index) the api's are also autogenerated bit wit-bindgen, these bindings are in some ways more complete as they include many portions of the browser bindings needed such as console, window, location but I think overall they are harder to work with because of the more low level nature they are also experimental and missing a few important api's, I will be working on these in the future, but for now they are good enough to get you started and play around with, you could also use both sets of bindings if you desired by composing grainDom with demos.

# Installation

The first step in using the program is to install all the dependencies:

- `yarn` - this project uses yarn v3 as the dependency manager, `npm` will likely work but it is not recommended and you are using it at your own risk.
- `wit-bindgen` - you are going to need to build the [grain wit bindgen branch](https://github.com/grain-lang/wit-bindgen/tree/grain) from source.
  - This will require the rust and cargo tool chains to be installed
  - `git clone https://github.com/grain-lang/wit-bindgen`
  - `cd wit-bindgen`
  - `git checkout grain`
  - `cargo build`
- `wasm-tools` - You will need to install [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools)
- `jco` - You will need [jco](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco) installed.
- `grain` - this project requires the latest version of the grain compiler `v0.6.7`

# Running

After you install the tools run the following commands:

```bash
yarn # Installs the projects dependencies
yarn cleanup # Cleans up any existing artifacts
yarn build # Builds the entire project
yarn start # Will rebuild the project and deploy a vite server for testing.
```

you can make any changes you want in `main.gr` for your project, note that you cannot run anything in the top scope of the module everything needs to exist in the `_start` function.

# How it works

This project uses the wasm component model to generate grain bindings to a javascript host interface these bindings can be found in `./src/grainWeb.wit` and the corresponding typescript api can be found in `./grainWeb.ts`. This is still extremely experimental so expect bugs if you try to replicate this project locally.

# Deriving your own work

Given the current state of component model getting your own project working outside of this is not the most straightforward but here is a small walkthrough:
The first step will be to understand `./build.sh` which handles generating the bindings from `./src/grainWeb.wit`, compiles your `main.gr` file and embeds the component into them, finally it outputs the jco runtime to `./dist` and a bundled version of `./src/grainWeb.ts`. Depending on what you want to build you will have to change various parts of this project.

## Adding bindings

Adding bindings is pretty easy it takes a little bit of [wit knowledge](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) to add new items to the `./src/grainWeb.wit` interface and then just make sure the corresponding items exist in `./src/grainWeb.ts`

## Ditching vite

Ditching vite should be pretty simple just take the files in `./dist/` and bring them over to your project importing them in the manner below:

```js
import { run } from './dist/app.component.js';
run.run();
```

you will need to use some sort of bundler as there is a dependency on `@bytecodealliance/preview2-shim`, you can provide your own wasi bindings to jco as well some documentation on jco can be found [here](https://bytecodealliance.github.io/jco/transpiling.html)

## Program Rules

Component model is still experimental in grain and not really supported as such interacting with it can be a tiny bit weird here are some considerations:

### Compiling

When compiling your grain program you need to compile with `--use-start-section` otherwise your module will not initialize correctly.

### `_start`

You cannot put any initialization code that calls wasi or host functions in the top level of any modules the entry point for your program is the `_start` function, I used a `type Start = () => Void` to ensure I was not accidentally returning any value as well.

### `cabi_realloc`

You need to export the `cabi_realloc` function like so from your main application:

```gr
@unsafe
provide let cabi_realloc = (originalPtr, originalSize, alignment, newSize) => {
  GrainWeb.cabi_realloc(originalPtr, originalSize, alignment, newSize)
}
```

Note instead of just re-exporting the function I cal the internal function from the new one this prevents grain from requiring any special closures or converting it into a regular grain export.

# Learning Component Model

If you want to learn more about [component model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) there are some resources but as the project is still young documentation is still sparse and tooling is still a little rough, feel free to make an issue if you run into a problem and I can try to debug with you if needed.

# Inspiration

The dom api is loosely inspired by [tiny-query-dom](https://github.com/nazmul-nhb/tiny-query-dom/tree/main) but with a focus on type safety and usability.

# TODO

- [x] Get initial component model setup and working for mvp
- [ ] Write a complete set of dom bindings
- [ ] Write tests using jest
- [ ] Write other important web bindings
- [ ] Write a dynamic dispatch function that allows for accessing anything else
  - This will be unsafe so we will mark it as such
- [ ] Look into how resources are freed as we pass handles into grain but we don't know when they are lost in grain-land?
- [ ] Write a bundler or plugin system so that users do not need to worry about the bindings steps:
  - Generate Bindings in a github action
  - Make a plugin (Rollup? webpack? i do not know yet)
  - Use wasm tools js api (if exists??) to
  - Use jco through js to generate our bindings
  - Use whatever tool im using to bundle everything into a single import
